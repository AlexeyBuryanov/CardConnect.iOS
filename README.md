The CardPointe Mobile iOS SDK seamlessly connects your iOS applications to CardSecure for tokenization of customer card data. Tokens and other associated payment details are then retrieved by your server and securely transmitted to the CardPointe Gateway for authorization, using a server-side REST client.
